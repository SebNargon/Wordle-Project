# Usage
Only "main.py", "solutionsupdated.txt", "wordsupdated.txt", and "total.txt" are needed to run the solver. The other files are in case of modifications to Wordle's official lists.

# Modification
If Wordle's official possible words or solutions change, "solutions.txt" and "words.txt" must be replaced with the new ones, and "Setup database.py" must be run to update the necessary text files.
